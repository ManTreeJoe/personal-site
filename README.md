Personal portfolio site for **Nathan Bupte** — developer, videographer, and photographer.

## About Me

I'm a full-stack developer and creative with a B.S. in Computer Science from Cal State Fullerton. I currently work as a Services Engineer at SwiftComply and Form Developer at CloudCompli. Outside of work, I shoot video, take photos, and rock climb.

## About This Site

A single-page portfolio with a dark, retro-modern aesthetic inspired by film and analog media. The design features film grain overlays, chromatic aberration, lens blur, and warm orange accents — think old projector meets modern web.
